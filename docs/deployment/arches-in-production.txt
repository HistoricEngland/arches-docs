Set DEBUG = False
#################

Most importantly, you should never run Arches in production with ``DEBUG = True``. Open your ``settings.py`` file (or ``settings_local.py``) and set ``DEBUG = False`` (just add that line if necessary).

Turning off the Django debug mode will:

1. Suppress the verbose Django error messages in favor of a standard 404 or 500 error page.

    You will now find Django error messages printed in your ``arches.log`` file.

    .. IMPORTANT:: Make sure you have ``500.htm`` and ``404.htm`` files in your project's templates directory!

2. Cause Django to stop serving static files.

    You must set up a real webserver, like Apache or Nginx, to serve your app. See :ref:`Serving Arches with Apache`.
