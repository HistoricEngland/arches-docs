Arches Glossary
###############

The Arches project uses a number of specialized terms. The following glossary provides definitions to Arches terminology as well as links to relevant parts of the documentation relevant to different terms. 


* **Arches Designer** A user interface for facilitating database design, i.e. the creation of Resource Models. The Arches Designer consists of many different tools, such as the Graph Designer and Card Manager, each of which helps build a different facet of Resource Model creation.

* **Basemaps** Underlying map layers which include, by default, aerial imagery, streetmaps, or terrain. You can also add your own basemaps through the same process as adding overlays.

* **Branch** Branches are building blocks that aid in the creation of resource models. When you add a branch to a resource model, its contents are copied into the resource model. This allows you to further customize the resource model while leaving the original branch unaltered.

* **Card** Cards are used to configure the data entry representation of a branch's graph; they define how information will be collected for each nodegroup. In some cases a complex branch may have multiple cards, whcih will be aggregated into a card container. Cards contain widgets, and determined how the widgets are ordered in the user interface.

* **Concept** A vocabulary term that is used throughout the Arches database to define resource. A concept has a preferred label ("house") and may have any number of alternative labels ("domicile", "townhouse"). When searching your database, a search for "domicile" would automatically use the "house" concept.
