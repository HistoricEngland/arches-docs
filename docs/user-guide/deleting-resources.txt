Deleting Resources
##################

Arches provides user interface features to delete node instances used to describe resource instances. Arches also provides user interface features to delete any single given resource instance. Finally, Arches provides a feature to delete all resource instances for a given resource model.


Select a Resource Instance to Edit or Delete
--------------------------------------------
To find a resource instance that you want to delete, you can start by using the search interface (learn more here: :ref:`Searching`). Assuming you are logged in as a user with permissions to edit the resource instance of interest, you should find a link to **Edit** the resource instance in the search results. The animation below illustrates the use of search and the **Edit** link:
