This section of the documentation provides guidance on how to install Arches. As an "enterprise-level" system, Arches is designed for deployment in organizational contexts with both needs and capabilities beyond those typical of an individual person. While Arches can be installed and tested on a personal computer, it is designed for deployment on servers in a networked environment.

Arches can be deployed for testing on a personal computer provided one has administrative permissions, some comfort and familiarity with command line interfaces, and (typically) some patience with trouble shooting. "Production" deployments (either public or private to an organizational setting) requires some experience with Web hosting, IT systems administration and, if using a cloud service provider, cloud computing infrastructure. These skills are needed to install, configure, and (critically) maintain Arches.
