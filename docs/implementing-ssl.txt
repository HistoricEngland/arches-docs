Implementing SSL
################

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enables the server to establish an encrypted link with its clients. This is more secure than using unencrypted communication. To implement SSL you will need a digital certificate which can be signed either by you or by a Certificate Authority. For more information about the SSL certificates please see `this article <https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-ssl-certificate>`. 

Implementing SSL on your server can be divided to two stages:

1. Obtaining the SSL certificate.
2. Configuring the webserver.
