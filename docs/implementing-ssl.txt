Implementing SSL
################

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enables the server to establish an encrypted link with its clients. This is more secure than using unencrypted communication. To implement SSL you will need a digital certificate which can be signed either by you or by a certificate authority. For more information about the SSL certificates please see `this article <https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-ssl-certificate>`_ . 

Implementing SSL on your server can be divided to two stages:

1. Obtaining a SSL certificate.
2. Configuring the webserver.

***************************
Obtaining a SSL certificate
***************************
SSL certificate can be singed either by you using your own private key or by a certificate authority. Each choices has its own prerequisites and consequences. 


Self singed
===========
A good guide about how to implement this using OpenSSL on Ubuntu 20.04 can be found `here <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-20-04>`_.

.. note::
    This option allows you to implement SSL using your server's IP address without a domain name. However, when accessing the website using any modern browser the connection will be marked as not private.
