Implementing SSL
################

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enables the server to establish an encrypted link with its clients. This is more secure than using unencrypted communication. To implement SSL you will need a digital certificate which can be signed either by you or by a certificate authority. For more information about the SSL certificates please see `this article <https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-ssl-certificate>`_ . 

Implementing SSL on your server can be divided to two stages:

+ :ref:`Obtaining a SSL certificate`
+ :ref:`Configuring the webserver`


Obtaining a SSL certificate
***************************
SSL certificate can be signed either by you using your own private key or by a certificate authority. Each choices has its own prerequisites and consequences. 


Self signed
===========
A good guide about how to implement this using OpenSSL on Ubuntu 20.04 can be found `here <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-20-04>`_.

.. note::
    This option allows you to implement SSL using your server's IP address without a domain name. However, when accessing the website using any modern browser the connection will be marked as not private.

Signed by Let's encrypt
=======================

`Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_ *is a non-profit certificate authority run by Internet Security Research Group that provides X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security encryption at no charge.*. You can obtain a certificate from other certificate authorities too. Please keep in mind that some authorities require a fee for their services. 

.. note::
    For this option you will need a domain name to use for your website

Install certbot
---------------
certbot is a tool that helps you obtain a certificate from Let's encrypt. `The official installation instructions for apache running on Ubuntu 20.04 can be found here <https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntufocal-apache>`_
