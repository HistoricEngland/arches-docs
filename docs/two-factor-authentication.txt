Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that you're the only person who can access your Arches account, even if someone knows your password.

How Two-factor Authentication Works
-----------------------------------------
Two-factor Authentication is the technical term for the process of requiring a user to verify their identity in two unique ways before they are granted access to the system. 
Users typically rely on authentication systems that require them to provide a unique identifier such as an email address or username and a correct password to gain access to the system.
Two-factor Authentication extends this by adding an additional step that requires the user to enter a one-time dynamically generated token that has been delivered through a secondary method that presumably only the user has access to.
This token is randomly generated and lasts a brief period of time before changing. It is based on an encrypted secret key that is stored in the application and secondary system ( eg. smartphone ).

Two-factor Authentication gives the user and system administrator a peace of mind that even if the user's password is compromised, 
the account cannot be accessed without also knowing the dynamically generated one-time password.

Enabling Two-factor Authentication in Arches
-----------------------------
There are two configurable settings, ``ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` and ``FORCE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`. Each accepts a value of ``True`` or ``False``.

* ``ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` - Allows users to enable two-factor authentication via their ``UserProfile``, and redirects login of users that have enabled two-factor authentication to secondary credentials page.
* ``FORCE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` - Must have ``ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` enabled. Forces all users to log in with two-factor authentication credentials.

.. note::
  ``ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` and ``FORCE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` do not trigger any other actions, such as terminating user sessions.


Setting up Two-factor Authentication for User Accounts
-----------------------------
If ``ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` or ``FORCE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION`` have been enabled in your Arches application, users can check the status of their accounts in the User Profile page.

From User Profile Edit page, Users can send an email to their registered email address containing instructions to set up two-factor authentication.
