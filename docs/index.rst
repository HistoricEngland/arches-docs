====================

Arches is an open-source data management platform originally developed for the cultural heritage field by the `Getty Conservation Institute <https://www.getty.edu/conservation/>`_ and `World Monuments Fund <https://www.wmf.org/>`_. Due to the complex and varied nature of cultural heritage data, and to promote interoperability and sustainable data practices, the Arches Platform has been developed as a standards-based, comprehensive and flexible platform that supports a wide array of uses.
