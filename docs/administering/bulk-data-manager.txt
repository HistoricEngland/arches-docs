Bulk Data Manager
#################

As of version 7.4, Arches provides **Bulk Data Manager** user interface tools for administrators to import and update large sets of data "in bulk". These allow administrators to make changes across large sets of data, not just record by record.


----------------------------
Enable the Bulk Data Manager
----------------------------
The Bulk Data Manager is an Arches plugin (see :ref:`Plugins`). This plugin will be installed when you install Arches, but, by default, the Bulk Data Manager will be hidden.

To enable use of the Bulk Data Manager, login to the :ref:`Django Admin User Interface <django admin user interface>` and click the link to "Plugins" under models, click the "Bulk Data Manager", and edit the JSON value for the attribute "Config".

To enable use of the Bulk Data Manager the Config should be: ``{"show": true}``. To disable use of the Bulk Data Manager, the Config should be: ``{"show": false}``. Once you've made your change, press the "Save" button in the lower right.

The image below illustrates how to enable the Bulk Data Manager:

    Enable the Bulk Data Manager via the Django Admin panel.


.. note:: The Bulk Data Manager requires that you have properly installed and configured :ref:`Task Management` with Celery.


----------------------------
Using the Bulk Data Manager
----------------------------
Once you've enabled the Bulk Data Manager, Arches administrators will have access to Import, Edit, and Export functionality.

Edit
====
The **Edit** tab of the Bulk Data Manager enables Arches administrators to make mass edits of string data across many resource instances. As of version 7.4.0, the current string editing options include:

1. Change classes
2. Replace Text
3. Remove Whitespace

Each editing option can be applied to selected node and languages within selected resource instances. The editing interface provides multiple options for selecting resource instances to update with a bulk edit. These options include:

1. Use search url
    One can copy and paste a URL of a search that retrieves a set of resource instances you want to edit

2. Select a resource model
    Use the dropdown list to select a resource model with resource instances that you want to edit

Use the other drop down lists to select nodes for editing, change the "From" and "To" text (if you are doing a "Replace Text" edit), and get a preview of how your edit would look. To actually make the edit, press the Start button. This may take some time, especially if you are updating many resource instances. Updates also trigger re-indexing, which can also take some time.
