Configuring Captcha
####################

Setting up your captcha will help protect your production from spam and other unwanted bots. To set up your production with captcha, first `register your captcha <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3beta.html>`_ and then add the captcha keys to your project's settings.py. Do this by adding the following::

    RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'x'
    RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = 'x'

Replace the x's with your captcha keys.

####################
User Sign-up
####################

To enable users to sign up through the Arches UI, you will have to add the following lines of code to your project's settings.py::

    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'xxxx@xxx.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'xxxxxxx'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587

Update the EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD with the correct email credentials and save the file. It is possible that this may not be enough to support your production of Arches. In that case, there's more information on setting up an email backend on the `Django site <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/email/#smtp-backend>`_.

To configure what group new users are put into, add the following lines of code to your project's settings.py::

    # group to assign users who self sign up via the web ui
    USER_SIGNUP_GROUP = 'Crowdsource Editor'

If you would like to change which group new users are added to, replace 'Crowdsource Editor' with the group you would like to use.
